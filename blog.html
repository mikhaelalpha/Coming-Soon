            <p class="courier2">My Strange Grandfather is a beautiful stop-motion animation by Dina Velikovskaya that tells a story of a girl and her ‘strange’ grandfather who turns trash into something wonderful.</p>
            <p class="courier2">There are three main sections in the 90-second clip. Each one with its own mood. The first section is when the girl found her grandfather in the dumpster as she tried to get the ball she kicked too far. Her friends laughed at her, hence the mood: embarrassment. Next, the scene at night when the girl is alone at the house while her grandfather is alone at his workshop inventing. The mood: solitude and creativity. Finally, the girl approached her grandfather before he showed her his magical creature. The girl liked what she saw, ending with the mood: amazement.</p>
            <p class="courier2">The foley and sound design created for this clip will help convey the emotions of the characters in this warm-toned animation and build realism to the fictional stop-motion world. Just like the ‘strange’ grandfather, the foley and sound design will be made generally from trash or waste material of different sonic quality including plastic bag, glass bottle, metal objects, etc. Not only will this give the overall sound its character, it will also lend a deeper meaning to the storytelling as a whole. Other sounds that are impractical to record or recreate will be sourced from the internet and altered purposefully. In addition to the foley and sound design, automated dialogue recordings of the different characters will be made in order to establish the different moods.</p>
