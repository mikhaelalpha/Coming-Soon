                    <p>First, insert a coin. Tika (the A.I.) then greets you. 
                        Choose the musical era you want with the knob in front of you. 
                        You’ll get a sample of the music in that era. Once you’ve made your choice, 
                        she asks for your confirmation. In just a few seconds, you will travel back in time!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sounds used in this project comes from recordings, internet sources, 
                        and software instruments. Sounds recorded include hoover, coins, papers in a book, 
                        and water. To create the main engine, the hoover recording is put into a sampler, which 
                        allows for pitch and transient control. Different reverb, delay, and rates of 
                        tremolos are added to emulate engine working. Other sounds from the recordings are 
                        processed and added to the main engine to create a magical atmosphere.

                    <p>
                        A (processed) piano is used for the machine’s melodic sound. To show the reverse 
                        in time, the ‘power on’ piano melody is played reversed during time travel. Other 
                        sounds from the recordings are also reversed for the same reason. To accompany 
                        the piano, strings with different bowing techniques and harp play ethereal chords. 
                        Of course, with all of them musically processed. The knob sound are made from an 
                        internet-sourced sound of a ticking clock, which was then put into a sampler instrument 
                        for easier rhythmic input. Finally, to base it all off, a couple of sine waves were 
                        used for the beginning and end.
