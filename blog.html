            <p class="courier2">“Lifted” is a Pixar short about a young alien named Stu in his abduction exam, trying to lift a farmer up to the spaceship. Stu is struggling to complete his test under the strict supervision of Mr.B, the impassive examiner. The foley and sound effects heard in the video tried to follow the tone of this animation; fictional, light, and comical.</p>
            <p class="courier2">A range of objects, with different material and sound quality was used for the foley process. These objects were manipulated and played around to achieve different effects.  A balloon was inflated and rubbed with a wet finger to emulate the creaking noise of a wooden bench.  3,5mm jack cables were struck for the ticking of the clock and was rubbed against itself for the flicking of the switch.</p>
            <p class="courier2">Several background ambiences were also created to enforce setting and ensure continuity. The outdoor winds were achieved by blowing air into the Beyerdynamic MC386, with light whistles. The ticking clock was used for the farmer’s room. The spaceship ambience was made by inhaling air through a plastic straw, which was then phased-processed.</p>
            <p class="courier2">To capture the different emotions of the character in this short, the versatile and reliable human voice was used. The farmer is clueless. He snores and breathes heavily, showing that he is still deeply asleep. Young Stu is hesitant and nervous. His remarks are high pitched and shaky. Mr.B, on the other hand, is aloof. Without opening his mouth, his voice is deep with strong air coming out.</p>
